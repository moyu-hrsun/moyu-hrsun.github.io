Hello! I am **Haoran Sun**, and also **Yu Mo**, a NLP research intern at Alibaba Group, Beijing. Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree from Hunan University.

My research interest lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a particular focus on the application of large language models (LLMs) like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agents. Presently, I am engaged in enhancing the instruction-following capability of LLMs in complex constrained scenarios.
